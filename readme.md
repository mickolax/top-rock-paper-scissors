The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors game

What has been done?

3.9.2020
- Updated the project to match the requirements of DOM Manipulation lesson:
    - UI for the games with selection buttons
    - Scoreboard that is updated with the buttons / UI

30.8.2020
- Created the basic functionalities of the rock paper scissors game including:
    - random selection for the computer -> computerPlay()
    - function playRound() that plays one round as long as it has a playerSelection and computerSelection
    - function game() which plays 5 rounds, asking the player selection at the start of each round using a prompt



Improvement ideas & questions:

- How to set the .toLowerCase inside the playRound() function as stated in the assignment? Is it OK to just be inside the game() function prompt?
- What to do with errors like making a typo on the prompt? --> This could be avoided by making the selection a button selection or drop-down selection. Perhaps that's done in future UI / FrontEnd code?
